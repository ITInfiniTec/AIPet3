CritterCraft: An AI Pet Universe Forged on the Blockchain
Welcome to the CritterCraft project! This repository contains the conceptual design, strategic planning documents, and UI mockups for a unique AI Giga Pet / Tamagotchi-style application built on a custom Substrate-based blockchain (CritterChain).

Project Vision
CritterCraft aims to create a universe where digital companions are intelligent beings with unique personalities, moods, and growth journeys. Their existence, attributes, and achievements are immutably recorded on a decentralized ledger. Players cultivate these AI pets, guide their development, engage them in competitive Pokémon-esque battles, send them on Neopets-style quests, and participate in a rich, player-driven economy.

The ecosystem is designed to allow users to earn real value through various activities including starting shops, taking on blockchain support jobs, participating in network consensus (PoS/DPoS), voting on the network's future, engaging in competitive gameplay, and much more, all underpinned by blockchain technology.

Project Documentation Structure
This repository serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the CritterCraft project. The key design, strategy, and conceptual documents are organized as follows:

Core Design & Feature Outlines:

Advanced Features & Gameplay Loops (ADVANCED_FEATURES.md): Details on future gameplay mechanics like Pet Breeding, Pet Day Cares, User Shops, Advanced Jobs, Treasure Hunts, and Mini-Games, including their conceptual UI designs.
Architectural Principles (ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md): Outlines the core philosophies guiding the development and evolution of CritterCraft's architecture, emphasizing modularity, security, and adaptability.
Blockchain Architecture & Technical Strategy:

Consensus Migration Plan (PoA to PoS/DPoS) (CONSENSUS_MIGRATION.md): Details the plan and technical "recipe" for transitioning CritterChain to a Nominated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, including pallet configurations and genesis setup.
Scalability Plan (SCALABILITY_PLAN.md): Outlines strategies for long-term scalability, primarily focusing on becoming a Polkadot/Kusama parachain.
Interoperability Plan (INTEROPERABILITY.md): Describes plans for cross-chain compatibility, including XCM for the Polkadot ecosystem and bridging to external chains like Ethereum.
Ecosystem Governance & Operations:

Governance Model (GOVERNANCE.md): Outlines the conceptual framework for decentralized governance of CritterCraft, including the roles of PTCN, pallet-democracy, pallet-collective, and pallet-treasury, along with conceptual UI flows.
Security & Auditing Plan (SECURITY_PLAN.md): Details the comprehensive security strategy, covering code audits, bug bounty programs, incident response, treasury security, and key management.
Community & Launch Strategy (LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md): Provides a high-level strategy for community building, token distribution (conceptual), a phased mainnet launch, and post-launch marketing.
Conceptual UI Prototype:

UI Wallet Mockup (blockchain_core/ui-wallet/index.html): An HTML file containing static mockups and placeholders for the CritterCraft UI wallet, demonstrating conceptual user flows for most features. (Note: This is a conceptual prototype, not a functional application).
Pallet Code (Conceptual Outlines):

The blockchain_core/pallets/ directory contains conceptual Substrate pallet code (lib.rs outlines) for:
pallet-critter-nfts (Core Pet NFT logic)
pallet-marketplace (NFT buying/selling)
pallet-battles (Pet battle registration & outcome reporting)
pallet-quests (Quest management & completion)
pallet-breeding (Conceptual outline for pet breeding)
Current Status
This project is currently in the advanced conceptual design and strategic planning phase. The documents and UI mockups represent a detailed blueprint for future development. No live network or fully implemented pallets exist based solely on this repository's current state.

Navigating the Project
Start with this README.md to understand the document structure.
Explore the linked markdown files for detailed information on specific aspects of the project.
Review the conceptual pallet outlines in the blockchain_core/pallets/ directory.
